<p>    
    The Marians of the Immaculate Conception played a key role in spreading The Divine Mercy message and devotion through the world, which was acknowledged by Pope John Paul II in a Papal Blessing on October 5, 2001.

    <b>Papal Blessing for the Marians of the Immaculate Conception</b>
    <br>
    On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the revelation of The Divine Mercy Message and Devotion, granted to the Church by Our Lord, Jesus Christ, through St. Maria Faustina Kowalska as well as of the 60th anniversary of the promotion of this message and devotion throughout the world by you, Marians of the Immaculate Conception of the B.V.M., of the St. Stanislaus Kostka Province, headquartered on Eden Hill in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, in the United States of America, I hereby thank you for your participation with others in the successful conclusion of St. Maria Faustina’s Canonization Cause; And I encourage you to "be Apostles of The Divine Mercy under the maternal and loving guidance of Mary…"
    <br>
    <br> 
    
    That "by deed, word, and prayer" you would proclaim this urgent and salutary message of and devotion to Jesus—The Divine Mercy, especially as you minister to the needs of the faithful who come on pilgrimage to The National Shrine of The Divine Mercy, placed in your country, by God’s Providence, under your solicitous care. As a token of an abundance of Divine Blessings, upon you, your Marian Associates, Helpers and Benefactors, I impart My Most Heartfelt Apostolic Blessing!

    <br> 
    
    Signed: John Paul II
